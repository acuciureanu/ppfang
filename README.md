Is a tool which helps identifying prototype polluting libraries from [cdnjs.com](https://cdnjs.com/).

The idea came to my mind after checking out a tool named [cdnjs-prototype-pollution](https://github.com/aszx87410/cdnjs-prototype-pollution)
written by [@aszx87410](https://github.com/aszx87410) aka Huli.

My motivation was to create my own tool with a slightly different approach.

##### Install dependencies

```sh
$ npm install
```

##### Run the tool

```sh
$ node index.js
```

##### Greetings to everyone
